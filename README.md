The goal of a consensus algorithm is for many different nodes communicating with each other across a network to reach agreement. In the context of blockchain protocols, this means all participating nodes must enter transactions into the blockchain in the same order. However, the complexity of consensus algorithms creates a greater need for thorough testing to ensure correctness. In order for these algorithms to be correct there are two essential conditions which must be satisfied, and many testing tools continuously monitor these conditions to determine if a bug in the algorithm has been found. In this work we discuss a different condition we call fairness. Fairness ensures that all messages getting sent through the network are processed in roughly the same order they were received, which helps ensure that certain messages arenâ€™t being delayed unfairly or processed out of order. This repository contains a simple program that can monitor a network of nodes and check if the algorithm satisfies fairness.
